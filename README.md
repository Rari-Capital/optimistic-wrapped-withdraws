# optimistic-wrapped-withdraws

Wrap a L2 ERC20 withdrawal event as an ERC1155 subtoken on L1


### Disclaimer 

This is incomplete and unsafe. Do not use this in production. 

This was written when Optimism's bridge spec was much simpler, a safe and production ready version of `optimistic-wrapped-withdraws` could be developed with the new Optimism bridges... **but we have no plans to do this at the moment.**
